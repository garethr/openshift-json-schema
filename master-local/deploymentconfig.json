  "description": "Deployment Configs define the template for a pod and manages deploying new images or configuration changes. A single deployment configuration is usually analogous to a single micro-service. Can support many different deployment patterns, including full restart, customizable rolling updates, and  fully custom behaviors, as well as pre- and post- deployment hooks. Each individual deployment is represented as a replication controller.\n\nA deployment is \"triggered\" when its configuration is changed or a tag in an Image Stream is changed. Triggers can be disabled to allow manual control over a deployment. The \"strategy\" determines how the deployment is carried out and may be changed at any time. The `latestVersion` field is updated when a new deployment is triggered by any means.",
